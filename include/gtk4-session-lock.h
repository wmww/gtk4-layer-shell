 * @title: GTK4 Session Lock
 * @short_description: GTK4 support for the Session Lock Wayland protocol
 *
 * [Session Lock](https://wayland.app/protocols/ext-session-lock-v1)
 * is a Wayland protocol for lock screens. Use it to lock the compositor
 * and display the lock screen. This library and the underlying Wayland
 * protocol do not handle authentication.
 *
 * # Note on popups
 * Popups (such as menus and tooltips) do not currently display while the screen is locked. Please use alternatives,
 * such as GtkPopover (which is backed by a subsurface instead of a popup).
 *
 * # Note On Linking
 * If you link against libwayland you must link this library before libwayland. See
 * [linking.md](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell/blob/main/linking.md) for details.
